// Explanation:

1. printArrayNonGen is a method that takes an array of Object in order to print out its content using a for loop.
2. printArray uses overload; four methods for each type. Also uses a for loop.
3. printArrayGen uses generic programming in order to make a type safe method of printArray (of #2). 
4. getMax takes in an array of Comparables and sorts it by size. The for loop compares the "i"th term and returns the biggest value by the end of the method. 
5. getMaxGen is the same method as 4, but with generic programming.
